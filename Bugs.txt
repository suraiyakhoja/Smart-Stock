- Sometimes running python app.py will stop working when it reaches a certain point in the code and you 
  will have to run it again. It stops working after trying to display Low Stock data so you won't see any 
  inventory data on the screen and you will have to do it again. 

- I was supposed to add a custom marker and popups to the map so users will know when product reached its 
  destination, but I ran out of time. Right now the markers look the same and its tricky to tell which markers
  mean what.

- Managing addresses on the map allows users to add and delete addresses and their markers would show up 
  on the map, but I was trying to get it to show up on the dashboard when users are buying/selling. The 
  dropdown menu was supposed to update with those addresses, but I couldn't send the data to the dashboard. 
  Currently the addresses in the dashboard dropdown menu have been hardcoded. 

- Sessions were supposed to be managed using JWT tokens but it never worked. The logout right now is inefficient 
  because it just redirects to the login page and clears local storage of the username, but I could not figure
  out how to get the token to show up in the inspector tools. The username was supposed to be saved but when I 
  would print a statement to the console to see if it was, it would print an empty string. 

- Buy/Sell feature does not work the first time.
